Quite a lot of people use portable devices like _Pendrives, Thumb drives, Hard Drives_, etc. There is a method in **Windows 10/8/7**, which can be used to store all important files and folders encrypted with a **password without installing any additional software**. This is basically a pre-defined _".bat"_ file which _encrypts all your data_ within the specified folder and will decrypt only upon authorised password.
