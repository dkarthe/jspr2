 OPPO is out with the new version of Find X with 10 Gigs of RAM

* Chinese manufacturer *OPPO* decided to launch a new version of *FIND X* with massive *10 GB of RAM* and certified to be the *world's first smartphone with such massive RAM*. According to the updated TENAA listing for the OPPO Find X, there will soon be an OPPO Find X with 10GB of RAM. As you may have guessed, this marks the first time anyone has ever put a *10GB RAM* inside a phone.

* The OPPO Find X comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 system-on-chip, up to 256GB storage, 3,730 mAh battery with VOOC fast charging support, and most importantly, a pop-up camera. This last addition gives the phone’s display a truly immersive look by ditching the notch and bezel. Also, the mechanism is kinda cool. Some of you may want to keep in mind that the OPPO Find X *doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner* of any kind as it *only comes with the built-in face-recognition*.

The TENAA listing suggests that the new version of the device will only come with bigger RAM. Everything else is basically the same, both on the inside and the outside. Unfortunately, we don’t know anything about the release date or the price of the device. The standard version of the device costs about $1150, so I can only imagine that 10GB RAM version won’t be any cheaper. We’ll make sure to update you as soon as we have new information about the device, so stay tuned.
